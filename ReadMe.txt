FolderSize 1.0.3

The program will list the size of a folder and its subfolders, up to 3 levels.
Unzip the file to a folder, run the AddContextMenu.exe program to add a
"FolderSize" command to the right-click context menu of each folder.
The tool will generate a registry entry and import it into the registry.
If you don't have administrator privileges on the computer, the tool will only
generate the registry file (AddContextMenu.reg) and you will have to add it
manually, by opening Regedit with administrator privileges and importing it
through the Import command of the File menu.
Once you have completed the operation, you can right click on any folder and
then click on FolderSize. A window will appear listing the folder size, followed
 by names, path and size of subfolders up to 3 levels. The folders are sorted by
 size in decreasing order, so you will know which folder is occupying more space
 on your drive. The info is in text format and can be copied (click on "Copy" in
 the "Edit" menu or select text and right click-Copy or CTRL-C) and pasted into
your text editor. You can also save the list to a text file (Save command on the
 File menu), useful, for instance, to print out or email a report.
If you don't want to add a registry entry to add a context menu, you can still
use the program, just drag and drop a folder to the program icon or start the
program from a Command Prompt window, with the folder path as an argument.
